Description.
------------
This is an attempt to write a converter from Rich Text
Format (RTF) to a HyperText Markup Language (HTML).

Supported specifications:
   - RTF 1.7
   - HTML 4.01
   - CSS2

The following modules are included:
  RTF::Lexer - low-level parsing of RTF-stream into tokens.
  RTF::HTMLConverter - this actually does the main job.
For more details see corresponding pod.

This is alpha software. Use it for your own risk. The author
will be grateful for your feedback.

Prerequisites.
--------------
  1. Perl 5.8.0 or higher
  2. Perl modules:
    2.1 Error
    2.2 Encode
    2.3 Any W3C DOM implementation (XML::GDOME or XML::DOM)

  For the image support the following required:
    2.4 File::Spec
    2.5 File::Temp
    2.6 Image::Info
  3. Image Magick (http://www.imagemagick.org/)
       You will need the 'convert' and 'mogrify' utilities.
  4. libwmf (http://sourceforge.net/projects/wvware/)
       You will need the 'wmf2eps' utility.
